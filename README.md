### Detecting Breast Cancer Using CNN

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Springboard/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Capstone_Project/Breast_Cancer_Capstone_Project.ipynb)
* Summary: Delving into breast histopathology images, this project harnessed the power of a Kaggle dataset, featuring 277,524 50x50 pixel patches. Through extensive model exploration, a simple CNN architecture emerged as the top performer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 83.36% and an AUC score of 0.915 in detecting IDC-positive and IDC-negative images.

### Detecting West Nile Virus Using Classifiers

* [Data Wrangling Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/capstone-project-2/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Capstone%20Project%202%20-%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)
* [EDA Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/capstone-project-2/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Project%202%20-%20EDA.ipynb)
* [Modeling Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/capstone-project-2/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Project%202-%20Pre-processing%2C%20Training%20%26%20Modeling.ipynb)
* Summary: Leveraging weather and trap data alongside engineered features, to predict the presence of West Nile virus (WNv) in the city of Chicago using XGBoostClassifier. With an AUC score of 0.8417, the model showcased significant predictive capability. Additionally, insights into optimal conditions for mosquito transmission were extracted using the SHAP package, contributing to enhanced understanding and proactive management of WNv transmission.

### Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews Using NLP and Logistic Regression

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/src/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
* Summary: In this project, sentiment analysis was conducted on a dataset of 4 million Amazon reviews using logistic regression. Achieving a precision score of 0.8856. Future steps include investigating alternative models like Random Forest and LSTM neural networks.

### Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Projects/blob/main/Customer%20Personality%20Analysis%20.ipynb)
* Summary: This project employs clustering algorithms like k-means and DBSCAN to segment customers based on demographic and spending attributes. The project yielded a k-means Silhouette Score of 0.3614 and a Calinski-Harabasz Index of 2845.15, while DBSCAN showed suboptimal performance.
