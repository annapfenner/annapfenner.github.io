### Project: Detecting Breast Cancer Using CNN

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Springboard/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Capstone_Project/Breast_Cancer_Capstone_Project.ipynb)
* Summary: Delving into breast histopathology images, this project harnessed the power of a Kaggle dataset, featuring 277,524 50x50 pixel patches. Through extensive model exploration, a simple CNN architecture emerged as the top performer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 83.36% and an AUC score of 0.915 in detecting IDC-positive and IDC-negative images.

### Detecting West Nile Virus Using Classifiers

* [Data Wrangling Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/capstone-project-2/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Capstone%20Project%202%20-%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)
* [EDA Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/capstone-project-2/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Project%202%20-%20EDA.ipynb)
* [Modeling Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/capstone-project-2/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Project%202-%20Pre-processing%2C%20Training%20%26%20Modeling.ipynb)
* Summary: Leveraging weather and trap data alongside engineered features, to predict the presence of West Nile virus (WNv) in the city of Chicago using XGBoostClassifier. With an AUC score of 0.8417, the model showcased significant predictive capability. Additionally, insights into optimal conditions for mosquito transmission were extracted using the SHAP package, contributing to enhanced understanding and proactive management of WNv transmission.

### Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews Using NLP and Logistic Regression

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/src/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
* **Why:** A 4.2-star review rating on Amazon might seem like a seal of approval, especially when accompanied by a handful of positive reviews. However, relying solely on these metrics can sometimes lead to disappointment. That's where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes in. By analyzing the sentiment of reviews for products, NLP can help uncover any discrepancies or potentially fake reviews, providing a more comprehensive understanding of customer satisfaction. With NLP, we can ensure that our purchasing decisions are based on genuine feedback, making for a more informed shopping experience.

* **Summary:** In this project, sentiment analysis was conducted on a dataset of 4 million Amazon reviews using logistic regression. Achieving a precision score of 0.8856. Future steps include investigating alternative models like Random Forest and LSTM neural networks.

### Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Projects/blob/main/Customer%20Personality%20Analysis%20.ipynb)
* **Why:** Harnessing the power of customer data, I delve into key factors like age, education, income, marital status, and spending habits. By employing advanced clustering algorithms, I've unearthed three distinct customer segments, enabling the development of highly targeted marketing strategies and fostering a deeper understanding of our company's customer base.

* Summary: This project employs two clustering algorithms, k-means and DBSCAN, to segment customers based on demographic and spending attributes. Through, the k-means model three distinct customer groups emerged. The k-means model showed the best results with a silhouette score of 0.3614 and a Calinski-Harabasz Index of 2845.15. 

### Fraud Detection Using SMOTEENN & Classification

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Projects/blob/main/Fraud%20Detection.ipynb)
* Summary: Both logistic regression and random forest classifiers achieved an AUC score of 1 on the precision-recall graph. These results signify the effectiveness of the models in identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

### Predicting Student's Math Score Using Linear Regression and XGBoost

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Projects/blob/main/student_performance.ipynb)
* Summary: The project focused on predicting students' math scores using a combination of categorical variables (such as parental education and lunch type) and reading & writing scores. Leveraging the linear regression algorithm, our model attained superior predictive performance, with an MSE score of 27.107 and an RÂ² value of 0.8808, demonstrating its efficacy in capturing the underlying relationships within the data.
