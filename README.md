* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Projects/blob/main/Customer%20Personality%20Analysis%20.ipynb)

**Why:** Utilizing clustering algorithms to group customers is essential for companies seeking to understand their customer base. This approach enables precision-targeted marketing and identifies growth opportunities within each customer segment.

**Summary:** This project utilizes k-means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to segment customers based on demographic and spending attributes. The k-means model revealed three distinct customer groups, achieving superior performance with a silhouette score of 0.3614 and a Calinski-Harabasz Index of 2845.15. By leveraging these insights, highly targeted marketing strategies can be developed to cater to the diverse needs of our customer base.

### Project 2: Predicting Student's Math Score Using Linear Regression

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Projects/blob/main/student_performance.ipynb)

* **Why:** Understanding the factors influencing students' academic performance is essential for educators and policymakers to implement targeted interventions and improve educational outcomes. By leveraging predictive modeling techniques, such as linear regression, we can identify key predictors of students' math scores and develop strategies to support their learning journey.

* **Summary:** The project focuses on predicting students' math scores by analyzing a variety of factors, including categorical variables like parental education and lunch type, as well as reading and writing scores. Utilizing the linear regression algorithm, our model achieved impressive predictive performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) score of 27.107 and an RÂ² value of 0.8808. These results highlight the model's effectiveness in capturing the underlying relationships within the data and providing valuable insights into the determinants of student academic success.

* [Final Report](https://github.com/annapfenner/Predicting-the-West-Nile-virus/blob/main/Final%20Report%20.pdf) | [Slide Deck](https://github.com/annapfenner/Predicting-the-West-Nile-virus/blob/main/Final%20Report%20.pdf)
* [Data Wrangling Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/capstone-project-2/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Capstone%20Project%202%20-%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb) | [EDA Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/capstone-project-2/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Project%202%20-%20EDA.ipynb) | [Modeling Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/capstone-project-2/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Project%202-%20Pre-processing%2C%20Training%20%26%20Modeling.ipynb)

* **Why:** After witnessing firsthand the devastating impact of vector-borne diseases on communities during travels abroad to the Dominican Republic and Gabon, I was motivated to contribute to the prevention and management of such diseases.

* **Summary:** This project utilized weather and trap data, alongside engineered features, to predict the presence of West Nile virus (WNv) in Chicago using the XGBoostClassifier. Achieving an impressive AUC score of 0.8417, the model demonstrated significant predictive capability. Furthermore, insights into optimal conditions for mosquito transmission were extracted using the SHAP package, enhancing understanding and proactive management of WNv transmission.

### Project 4: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews Using NLP and Logistic Regression

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/src/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
* **Why:** A 4.2-star review rating on Amazon might seem like a seal of approval, especially when accompanied by a handful of positive reviews. However, relying solely on these metrics can sometimes lead to disappointment. That's where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes in. By analyzing the sentiment of reviews for products, NLP can help uncover any discrepancies or potentially fake reviews, providing a more comprehensive understanding of customer satisfaction. With NLP, we can ensure that our purchasing decisions are based on genuine feedback, making for a more informed shopping experience.

* **Summary:** In this project, sentiment analysis was conducted on a dataset of 4 million Amazon reviews using logistic regression. Achieving a precision score of 0.8856. Future steps include investigating alternative models like Random Forest and LSTM neural networks.


### Project 5: Detecting Breast Cancer Using CNN

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Springboard/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Capstone_Project/Breast_Cancer_Capstone_Project.ipynb) 

* **Why:** The motivation behind this project stems from a deeply personal experience. A close friend of mine was diagnosed with stage IV cancer at a young age, highlighting the critical importance of early detection. With breast cancer being a prevalent concern, affecting approximately one in eight women in the US, it's imperative to leverage advanced technology to enhance detection methods. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which have shown remarkable accuracy in detecting breast cancer, is crucial in our ongoing efforts to save lives through early intervention and timely treatment.

* **Summary:** This project utilized a Kaggle dataset of breast histopathology images, comprising 277,524 50x50 pixel patches. Through model exploration, including transfer learning, a simple CNN architecture emerged as the top performer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 83.36% and an AUC score of 0.915 in detecting IDC-positive and IDC-negative images.


### Project 6: Credit Card Fraud
<img src="fraud.jpeg" alt="Project Image" width="400" height="200">

* [Project Notebook](https://github.com/annapfenner/Projects/blob/main/Fraud%20Detection.ipynb)

* **Why:** Identifying fraudulent transactions is crucial for financial institutions to safeguard their customers and maintain trust in the banking system. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques allows for the timely detection of fraudulent activity, minimizing potential losses and protecting against financial fraud.

* **Summary:** Both logistic regression and random forest classifiers achieved an AUC score of 1 on the precision-recall graph, indicating their exceptional performance in identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. These results underscore the effectiveness of the models in detecting and preventing credit card fraud, thereby enhancing security and confidence in financial transactions.
